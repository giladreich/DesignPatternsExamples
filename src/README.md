# The three basic kinds of design patterns
##### Structural patterns 
Generally deal with relationships between entities, making it easier for these entities to work together.

##### Creational patterns 
Provide instantiation mechanisms, making it easier to create objects in a way that suits the situation.

##### Behavioral patterns 
Are used in communications between entities and make it easier and more flexible for these entities to communicate.
