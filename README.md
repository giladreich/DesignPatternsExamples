# Three Basic Kinds of Design Patterns
##### Structural patterns 
Generally deal with relationships between entities, making it easier for these entities to work together.

##### Creational patterns 
Provide instantiation mechanisms, making it easier to create objects in a way that suits the situation.

##### Behavioral patterns 
Are used in communications between entities and make it easier and more flexible for these entities to communicate.

# Structural Patterns
##### Adapter Pattern
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn' t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

##### Bridge Pattern
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

##### Composite Pattern
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

##### Decorator Pattern
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

##### Facade Pattern 
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

##### Proxy Pattern
Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

# Creational Patterns
##### Abstract Factory Pattern
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

##### Factory Method Pattern
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

##### Singleton Pattern
Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

# Behavioral Patterns
##### Command Pattern
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

##### Iterator Pattern
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
![Iterator Pattern](/pictures/IteratorPattern.png)

##### Observer Pattern
Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
![Observer Pattern](/pictures/ObserverPattern.png)

##### State Pattern
Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
![State Pattern](/pictures/StatePattern.png)

##### Strategy Pattern
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm very independently from clients that use it.
![Strategy Pattern](/pictures/StrategyPattern.png)

##### Template Method Pattern
Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses.Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain ste ps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
